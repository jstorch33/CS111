Response to Exercise 1:
By replacing the 'run(current)' in interupt() with 'schedule()', the process
that called the sys_getpid() will now be run at a random time based off the 
number of processes that are scheduled to be run. This will cause registers 
to change value as more processes are run, however, since the answer is
stored in that particular processes' p_register, specifically its eax
register, the the same value will be availiable to the process when it
everntually runs. Thus the call will have returned the correct value.
