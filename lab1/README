Lab 1a:

Known limitations: Because we have not yet implemented all of the options, we
are only able to run the --rdonly, --wronly, --command, and --verbose. Thus,
we cannot run any test cases that require pipes as we have not yet
implemented the --pipe command. This is the biggest limitation, as it narrows
down the utility value of our program and the test we are able to run on it.

Without other commands such as --wait it is impossible for us to implement
some of the ideas in the spec such as the exit statuses among other things.

Lab 1b:

You must always have --wait called at the end for the child processes to not
hang up as the pipes will cause an endless loop. ALternitively you can also
close all the files after they are used although this is unnecessary as
we implemented --wait and --command to take care of this for you. The other
behavioral aspects of our program seem to work as intended.

Lab 1c:

After testing and averaging the five times for our three different tests on
simpsh, bash, and execline, every single test case leads execline to be
the best way to run the test. Our simpsh preformed comparably to that of
bash. Our code seems to work in all cases but our --profile seems to
sometimes give unreliable output when running on options but always gives
correct results when run on the child processes.
