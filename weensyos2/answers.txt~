Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is: 
Round Robin Scheduler, Do one instance of each process before moving on
to the next.


(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0:  1278.5ms
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1:  800ms

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0:  1.5ms
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1:  480ms


Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A, Exercise 4B, or both for extra credit?
Only 4A

Exercise 5:
The 4th process seems to be the one that is had the first clock interrupt
as the sequence pictured is missing a 4 on the 5th iteration through the
proccesses.
